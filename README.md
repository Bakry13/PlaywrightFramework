# Playwright Framework

*- The below description is a summary to build a solid test automation framework using playwright test automation tool and typescript programming language.*

*- You can use this framework to be a base for your test automation project to start your automated test cases.*

*- You can find more details in playwright official website documentation:*
https://playwright.dev/docs/intro

## `Preparation:`

#### 6- Allure report
* Adding allure report with more alnaytics and charts options to enhance readability and visibility to the test report
* Adjusting the report to attach (screenshots, videos, trace and console logs)

#### 7- Using BDD framework
* Adding the ability to apply BDD test automation framework using cucumber tool
* Adjustment for cucumber run (feature files, steps and cucumber.json for test runner)
* Adding cucumber report for logging the test results
* Adding a simple example of BDD tests

#### 8- Eslint tool for static analysis
* Adding the eslint dependency for static analysis for typescript code
* Adding .eslintc.js config file to adjust its rules

#### 13- node_modules/:
* All downloaded libraries and modules

### B. Project configuration files:

#### 1- playwright.config.ts, test.config.ts, staging.config.ts, api.config.ts: 
* The default generated file is "playwright.config.ts"
* Waits, browsers, fully parallel, reporters, default number of worksers, ...
* General configurations across the project

#### 2- package.json:
* Project properities
* Scripts and keywords
* Installed dependencies

#### 3- package-lock.json:
* Detailed Installed dependencies

#### 4- .gitIgnore:
* All files and folders that needs to be excluded from pushing to the version control

#### 5- .env:
* Environment variables
* Secrets
* Running language

#### 6- cucumber.json:

## `How to run?`

### A. Running normal test cases:

#### 1- Use direct command as below:

        npx playwright test

#### 2- Show the report:

        npx playwright show-report

#### 3- To pass the used environment or language you can use the below bash command:

        ENV=test LANGUAGE=ar npx playwright test

### B. Running test cases using a pre-defined script in package.json:

        npm run {predefined command}

### C. Running cucumber test:

        cucumber-js test

### D. Generating/ Openning Allure report:

#### 1- Generate the report:

        npx allure generate {report path} -o {generation path} --clean

#### 2- Open the report:

        npx allure open {generated report path}

## `Project Structure:`
*The below is a package diagram for the implemented project structure "Files and folders"*

![Screenshot](PlaywrightFramework.jpg)

## `General instructions and guidelines:`

* Specify files and tags that should be run according to bussiness group and testing needs

* Configure package.json file for frequently used commands

* Configure .env file for test environment, secrets and used lanugage

* Every test should have its representative name

* Pages should hold locators, strings, actions and assertions

* Assertions uses playwright validations and assertion module

* It is recommended to collect cases under descripe group

* Files and folders should be named with this formate {firstWord-SecondWord..}

* Variables and methods should start with small letters

* Write locators, scenario steps and tests in the order of the page under test

* Do not assert on existence of a certain element if we will assert on its text

* Do not write any functions if you will not use it

* For every api we create tests in spec file and general used bodies, headers and params under pages directory

* For using BDD approach, every feature should has 3 files (feature file - steps - page)

* For using BDD approach, feature files should have business scenarios

* For using BDD approach, steps should has technical steps and use pages

* For using BDD approach, steps module should be named with {featureName-steps}

* For using BDD approach, do not make more than 2 Then in the scenario except view page scenario

#### *`Notes:`*
* *It is not recommended to use BDD framework in playwright project as you will lose some of playwright advantages*
* *If you will not use BDD framework, you will need to remove these folders and files: (cucumber.json - features - steps)*
